 📦 Inventory Management System

📝 Overview

The **Inventory Management System** is a simple console-based application written in **C++**. It allows a small store to dynamically manage its inventory by adding, removing, updating, and displaying product quantities.

✨ Features
- ✅ **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Handle a variable number of products.
- ➕ **Adding Products**: Expand the inventory dynamically.
- ❌ **Removing Products**: Remove products and adjust the size accordingly.
- 🔄 **Updating Product Quantity**: Modify the quantity of a specific product.
- 📊 **Displaying Inventory**: View the current inventory in a structured format.
- 🛠 **Efficient Memory Management**: Uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

🚀 How It Works
1. 🔢 The program asks the user to input the number of products in the store.
2. 🛒 It dynamically allocates memory for storing the product quantities.
3. Users can:
   - ➕ Add new products (expanding the array dynamically).
   - ❌ Remove products (shrinking the array dynamically).
   - 🔄 Update the quantity of an existing product.
   - 📊 Display the updated inventory.
4. 🗑 Finally, the program deallocates memory before exiting.

🛠 Technologies Used
- 💻 **C++**
- 📂 **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (new, delete)
- ⌨️ **Standard Input/Output (iostream)**

🔮 Future Improvements
- 📜 Implement a **menu-driven approach** for better user experience.
- 🏗 Use **structures/classes** for better inventory management.
- 💾 Implement **file handling** for persistent inventory storage.
